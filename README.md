Remove Switcher Popup Delay Timeout
===================================

GNOME Shell extension that sets the switcher popup delay timeout to zero. GNOME
40 compatible. There are a bunch of these already, but with every new GNOME
release needing to have the extension updated, it is easier to just make ones
own.
